Final Project

Instructions:

Your mission should you choose to accept it:

First of all:

This project is in teams (the two-students teams that we already have since the first week of classes).
You should use your code of the previous homework about the Application of deep neural network for classifying cats.
I am attaching the original ZIP file of that previous homework:
Deep Learning NN Aplication-1.zip
Now:

Look for a new picture data set for classifying some thing else (dogs, cars, etc).
You can find this data set in a website, for example:
UCI Machine Learning Repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php (Links to an external site.)
Or somewhere else, for example:
https://towardsdatascience.com/top-sources-for-machine-learning-datasets-bb6d0dc3378b (Enlaces a un sitio externo.)
Important: do not use the same "cat data set" we used in that homework.
Adapt your new data set (if needed) or your code in order to upload your data set to your project.
Important: You MUST use the same code we have used in the Jupyter Notebook homework. Do NOT use other libraries with other implementations or architectures of NNs.
Split your data set in three parts: Train/Dev/Test Sets.
Then:

Train your Neural Net with the training set and check the results you get with the original net of your homework.
Improve your Neural Net architecture performance systematically (using the Dev Set) modifying the hyper-parameters:
Learning rate
The number of iterations.
Number of layers
Number of neurons in each layer
The activation function in each layer
Etc.
You will need to do several experiments systematically varying all these experiments in order to try to find the better hyper-parameters to improve your parameters W and b.
Remember that you also need to try to get low bias and low variance.
Finally, you can get your final performance estimation using the test set.
 

Important:

You must make a new Jupyter Notebook where I can run your systematic experiments with new Jupyter cells explaining your experiment steps and results.
Deliverable:

A ZIP file (with the name Final-Project-TeamXX.zip) with the following files inside: 
Another ZIP file with all the files needed for running your Jupyter Notebook explaining your systematic experiments with Jupyter cells explaining your experiment steps and results.
A PDF file with your final report with at least the following sections (you can add more sections if you want).
A PPT file for your presentation with a summary of your PDF final report.
A video (or link) of your presentation in teams with a summary of your PDF final report.
For the PDF and PPT you must include the following:
Cover page (with your personal data).
Introduction (motivation of your project with your data set).
Data Set (description of the data set you selected and you selected)
Methodology (description of how you made different systematically experiments to find the better hyper-parameters to achieve the best performance)
Results (description of your results using your methodology)
Final results (in your test set)
Conclusions
